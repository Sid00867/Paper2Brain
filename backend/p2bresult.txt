================ MAIN AGENT OUTPUT ================


--- EXTRACTOR_INSTRUCTIONS ---
Define:
- Structural roles that qualify an entity to become a node include the Planner, Encoder, Transition Model, Observation Model, Reward Model, and Action Repeat.
- Categories that must NOT become nodes include mathematical details, algorithm names, and narrative descriptions.
- Structural role completion is allowed for standard roles such as inputs, outputs, state representations, and control signals, but must be conservative and only include roles that are widely understood and necessary for coherence.
- The intended abstraction level is focused on operational and architectural structure, rather than conceptual labels or algorithm names.

--- EXTRACTOR_CONTEXT ---
The system consists of a Planner that uses a Transition Model, Observation Model, and Reward Model to predict future states and rewards. The Encoder infers the current state from past observations and actions. The Action Repeat determines how many times an action is repeated before the next observation is made. The system operates in a latent space, where the Transition Model and Encoder work together to predict future states and rewards.

--- RELATIONSHIP_INSTRUCTIONS ---
Define:
- Valid relationships include transitions between states, predictions of future rewards, and dependencies between the Planner, Encoder, Transition Model, Observation Model, and Reward Model.
- Relationships reflect runtime behavior, including the flow of information between components and the sequence of actions taken by the Planner.
- Constraints on directionality, multiplicity, and connectivity include the requirement that the Planner can only consider a limited number of action sequences, and that the Encoder can only infer the current state from past observations and actions.

--- RELATIONSHIP_CONTEXT ---
The Planner uses the Transition Model and Reward Model to predict future rewards and states, and selects the best action sequence based on these predictions. The Encoder infers the current state from past observations and actions, and provides this information to the Planner. The Transition Model and Observation Model work together to predict future states and observations, and the Reward Model predicts future rewards. The Action Repeat determines how many times an action is repeated before the next observation is made, and affects the flow of information between components.

--- JUSTIFIER_INSTRUCTIONS ---
Define:
- The expected depth and style of explanation is focused on architectural reasoning and mathematical intuition, with an emphasis on how the components of the system work together to achieve the desired outcome.
- The justification should emphasize the importance of the Planner, Encoder, Transition Model, Observation Model, and Reward Model, and how they interact to produce the desired behavior.
- Explicit focus areas include the role of the Action Repeat in determining the flow of information between components, and the importance of the Encoder in inferring the current state from past observations and actions.

--- JUSTIFIER_CONTEXT ---
The system's ability to learn latent dynamics and plan in latent space is due to the combination of the Planner, Encoder, Transition Model, Observation Model, and Reward Model. The Planner's ability to select the best action sequence based on predicted future rewards and states is critical to the system's performance, and relies on the accurate predictions of the Transition Model and Reward Model. The Encoder's ability to infer the current state from past observations and actions is also crucial, as it provides the necessary information for the Planner to make informed decisions. The Action Repeat plays a key role in determining the flow of information between components, and affects the system's ability to learn and adapt to new situations.
